A Javascript Range-Handling Library

Highlight is a simple library to manipulate range-based text selections, and apply transformations on text nodes in an easy, functionnal way.

The library is written in Typescript, and aims to not be dependent of any external module.

##Testing
You can run continuous integration test by running:
```
gulp
```
This task will handle Typescript compilation, for tests and library.

If you just want to run tests once:
```
gulp test
```
